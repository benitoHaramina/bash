# The following shell script creates links for all of these directories within the /tmp/tape directory and then creates a tar
# tape that can be sent. Note that the tar h option tells tar to follow symbolic links and 
# archive whatever is at the end of the link; otherwise, tar makes a copy of just the symbolic link
